# <EdX Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The aim of this webpage is to organise notes relating to the EdX prework study activities. This will act as an important reference for the remainder of the course. It solves the issue of having lots of notes in different places and not remembering key information. By creating this webpage, I have learnt how to start using command, VScode, Git, GitHub and other important elements that will help form the foundations of learning about front-end web development.

## Usage
